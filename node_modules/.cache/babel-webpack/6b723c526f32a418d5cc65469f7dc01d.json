Mutations can\n * create, replace, delete, and update subsets of documents.\n *\n * Mutations not only act on the value of the document but also its version.\n *\n * For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we preserve\n * the existing version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. For Delete\n * mutations, we reset the version to 0.\n *\n * Here's the expected transition table.\n *\n * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN\n *\n * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)\n * SetMutation        NoDocument(v3)        Document(v0)\n * SetMutation        null                  Document(v0)\n * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)\n * PatchMutation      NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)\n * PatchMutation      null                  null\n * TransformMutation  Document(v3)          Document(v3)\n * TransformMutation  NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)\n * TransformMutation  null                  null\n * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)          NoDocument(v0)\n * DeleteMutation     NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v0)\n * DeleteMutation     null                  NoDocument(v0)\n *\n * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as\n * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes\n * have no explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for\n * Delete mutations.\n *\n * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check\n * locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the\n * updated version.\n *\n * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being\n * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is\n * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation\n * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior\n * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not\n * necessarily for a PatchMutation).\n *\n * ## Subclassing Notes\n *\n * Subclasses of Mutation need to implement applyToRemoteDocument() and\n * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation\n * to some source document.\n */\n\n\nvar ze = function ze() {};\n/**\n * Applies this mutation to the given MaybeDocument or null for the purposes\n * of computing a new remote document.

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\n\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Xi(t) {\n  return Zr(t, Vr.store);\n}\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Zi(t) {\n  return Zr(t, Wr.store);\n}\n/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */\n\n\nfunction to(t, e) {\n  // Use two different prefix formats:\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n  // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n  // so there's no danger of collisions.\n  var n = t.projectId;\n  return t.m || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n  /**\n  * @license\n  * Copyright 2017 Google LLC\n  *\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n  *\n  *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n  *\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n  * limitations under the License.\n  */\n\n  /**\n  * A readonly view of the local state of all documents we're tracking (i.e. we\n  * have a cached version in remoteDocumentCache or local mutations for the\n  * document).
